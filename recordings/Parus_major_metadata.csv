The area includes fig trees (Ficus carica) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), providing medium to tall canopy for perching.

The bird was not seen. The vocalization is very clear and flute-like, repeated several times as ""fifi fi, fifi fi, fifi fiiuu"", with a descending pitch at the end. The recording has excellent clarity (Quality A), with little to no background noise.

Recording is unmodified except for light normalization; no filtering or cutting was applied.

Behavior: The bird sings only a few times per day, each session lasting about 2–3 minutes. This audio captures one of those rare vocalizations. No other individuals were interacting, and there was no visual contact.

Weather: Clear sky, mild temperature, low wind. Recorded in the early morning.

Background species may be present but not clearly identifiable.

Any help in identifying this species is welcome.",2025.0

Lorsque je le repère, il y a un autre oiseau (mésange charbonnière femelle). Le mâle se rapproche de moi, toujours avec ce cri (inquiétude ou contact avec la femelle ?). Arrivé à hauteur de l'entrée du nichoir, attaché à ce même arbre, il s'arrête et poursuit ses cris. La femelle approche mais est peu visible. Lui, il fait le va-et-vient de son perchoir au nichoir. Il s'accroche près de l'entrée et regarde parfois à l'intérieur. A un moment donné, il chante à deux reprises. Il va ensuite entrer dans le nichoir et en ressortir assez vite. La femelle va s'envoler et lui va la suivre. Ma présence dérangeait-elle (immobile avec mon enregistreur) ou la femelle (qui a mauvais goût) n'aime pas le nichoir que j'ai installé ? ",2024.0

Forest around the site of recording consist mostly of pines, spruce and  black alder. The bird itself wasn't seen but judging by the direction of the sound, it was somewhere high up in the canopy of a large spruce tree (about 20-25 m off the ground). Weather conditions at the time of recording - no precipitation, almost no wind, overcast skies, temperature around -10 C. 
The recording posted here was extracted from a video and trimmed to remove initial segment without the bird's voice. There is a bit of background noise from the nearby road but the bird's voice is heard quite clearly.
P.S. After some discussion in forum this recording was attributed to *Parus major* with a possible call of *Garrulus glandarius* in the background.",2022.0

There have been several great tits _(Parus major)_ in the immediate area throughout the day, and while I've never heard a great tit sound quite like the call in the recording, it is possible that the perpetrator is just an unusual great tit. However, I thought it was interesting and wanted to be sure. I've heard this particular call throughout the day, and have been unable to spot the bird making it. The area is suburban, and less than a hundred metres from a small patch of woodland. There are several large beech trees lining the road, and the bird seemed to be calling from one close by, though I wasn't able to spot it from my window, and therefore I assume the bird was rather small.

The weather was warm and sunny today, about 20 degrees centigrade, and there was little wind.

When first heard from indoors the call sounded like that of a Yellow-browed Warbler. The date - 25th September - was fine for an early Yellow-browed Warbler in Ireland so I rushed out into my garden. The calls kept coming from high up in alder trees and I then raced back indoors to fetch my recorder. I set the recorder down and then scanned to locate the bird. Soon I saw it and also watched it call. It was a Great Tit, a young male! It went quiet and then flew off. Two questions arise: if, as I think, the call is a good copy of Yellow-browed Warbler, had the Great Tit heard the real thing recently? Because it was a young bird, it could not have remembered if from a previous year. If the Great Tit did copy a real Yellow-browed Warbler then the Great Tit might itself have travelled to my garden in northeastern Ireland from, say, Yorkshire where it heard Yellow-browed Warblers recently (over 100 Yellow-browed Warblers at Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, a few days ago).

In this instance, I am the curiosity. The recording begins (during the first two seconds) with a popular 'pink, pink' refrain that precedes Great Tit's diagnostic 'revving' [please read detailed comments of XC202429 to establish what I mean by 'revving']. The 'pink, pink' seems to function as a copy of the same note commonly used by Chaffinch. At 0:04, the 'pink, pink' is dropped and only revving is uttered. After 0:04 (but closer to the fifth second) a faint Blue Tit call (this tuneful note serves as both song and alarm call) is heard in the background. Just after 0:07, the Great Tit delivers 'pink, pink, pink'. In the following few seconds the Great Tit moved farther off but, at 0:11, it prefaces revving with the trill of a Long-tailed Tit. Indeed, Long-tailed Tits were in the immediate area and, shortly after, both they and more Blue and Coal Tits all appeared like rats responding to the summons of the 'Pied Piper' Great Tit.",2013.0

Therefore, the same recording has been added to XC for Blue Tit at XC202479. The text (repeated from XC202479) applies equally to Great Tit: 'Blue Tit delivering its standard conversational trill (I prefer to call the sound 'revving'). This is a year-round call and is quite similar to an equivalent vocalisation in Great Tit. For more detailed discussion see [Great Tit] XC202429 and [Blue Tit] XC202431. The Blue Tit revving is recorded only within the first two seconds. At 0:04 a Great Tit delivers a single Dunnock-like 'peep' and does so again at 0:06 at which moment is then switches immediately to include its diagnostic revving. Hence, the recording facilitates hearing - and comparing - revving from both Blue Tit (within the first two seconds) and Great Tit (0:07).'",2013.0
202429,Parus,major,Great Tit,https://xeno-canto.org/202429/download,Anthony McGeehan ,United Kingdom,"Bangor, North Down, Northern Ireland",54.6565,-5.6753,30,call,2014-05-31,09:30,B,0:39,"Great Tits are renowned for the complexity of their vocabulary. Indeed, the more you immerse yourself in their language the more you appreciate the bird's communication skills. While it is exciting and a privilege to listen to everything they say, the result is that you begin to feel like a code-breaker - and this obliges you to take notes of the various sounds and permutations of sounds. Clearly, one recording on Xeno-canto is not going to serve as a Rosetta stone for deciphering the meaning of every utterance! Nonetheless, one standard sound is given by Great Tit and Blue Tit. The utterance is quite similar in both species and seems to be a constant feature in their phraseology throughout the year. Consequently, an ability to distinguish the two on the basis of the sound is very useful. To my mind, the vocalisation comes across as a kind of 'revving'. In Great Tit, the revving is homogeneous - flat without any change in pitch. And it ends just as it began. So its sheer 'sameness' is, in fact, distinctive. The revving of Blue Tit is different in two ways. On the one hand it rises slightly in pitch [XC202431] and also seems to accelerate a little. But back to Great Tit. Often Great Tit prefaces its revving with (usually single) another note. The prefaced note may be unique to Great Tit or it may instead be a copy of other species that the Great Tit knows to be present in the area. By imitating the note from its neighbours it may be copying 'for fun' or to alert its neighbours to the fact that it has rumbled something interesting or alarming, such as perceived danger in the form of a human trespasser, stalking cat or other predator. The intention behind copying may not be altruistic but could be to imitate the other species so precisely that individuals may join the Great Tit - because they believe that the sound has, in reality, emanated from one of their peers. In Ireland, the two species imitated most in this way are Chaffinch and Dunnock. In the recording, no species is imitated before revving. However, a high-pitched 'air-escaping-from-piston' sound (that can be matched by a very similar sound in Blue Tit's repertoire) is given either on its own [just after 0:10] 
or - in classic fashion - by being added as a preface to revving. The 'piston' note is combined with revving just after 0:21, just after 0:25, 0:31, 0:34 and 0:37. In total, 20 sound bites are uttered in the course of this recording. For the record these are: over the first 10 seconds, a total of 5 'revving' bursts; the sixth note is a piston sound; sound bites 7, 8 and 9 are revving; sound bite 10 is a piston prefacing revving; 11 and 12 are revving only; 13 is a piston prefacing revving; 14 and 15 are revving only; 16 is piston prefacing revving; 17 is revving; 18 is piston prefacing revving; 19 is revving; 20 is piston prefacing revving.
